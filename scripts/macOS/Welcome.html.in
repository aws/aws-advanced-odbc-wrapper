<h2>
  Amazon Web Services (AWS) Advanced ODBC Wrapper Installer
</h2>

<p>
  This is the macOS installer for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Advanced ODBC Wrapper.

<p>
  The AWS Advanced ODBC Wrapper is complementary to existing ODBC drivers and aims to extend the functionality of these
  driver to enable applications to take full advantage of the features of clustered databases such as Amazon Aurora. In
  other words, the AWS Advanced ODBC Wrapper does not connect directly to any database, but enables support of AWS and
  Aurora functionalities on top of an underlying ODBC driver of the user's choice. This approach enables
  service-specific enhancements, without requiring users to change their workflow and existing ODBC driver tooling.
